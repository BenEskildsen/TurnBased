- hex grid
  - need to support non-hex-grid in neighbor/inFront selectors
- get it up and running
  - need to tie action animations/execution to turn cycling
  - entities doing one action per turn?


- level editor
  - EDITOR screen + picker on main menu
  - add level editor functions to bee/cell/background
  - how to turn editor function on entity into an entity that
    gets made with the selected properties
    - callback for args array that stays up to date?
- level loading
  - level loading functions from Tower Defense
  - not as much nonsense with SET_PLAYERS_AND_SIZE

- turn reducers (need in bee game idea?)
  - allowing players to control their entities on their turn
  - how to control entities (one action per turn, energy, etc)


- split out before going too hard on bees game

- AI
  - position evaluation + shallow/greedy exploration

- possible games
  - bee "card" game
    - when bees are born they are assigned a task permanently
    - tasks:
      - get honey
      - feed larva
      - build cells
      - scout for food
      - clean cells
      - fan heat
      - nectar -> honey?
    - events:
      - queen lays eggs
      - egg -> larva -> pupa -> worker
      - cell gets built
      - cell gets dirty
      - cell/larva gets hot
      - wasp attacks
    - choices player makes:
      - worker bee tasks
      - where to build cells?

  - bees vs wasps hive-like
  - generals, armies, spies
